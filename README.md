# Auto LinkedIn
This Chrome extension allows you to automatically add contacts in LinkedIn. 
I had this idea when I saw someone's post on my LinkedIn feed. He made a similar thing, 
but I found that the design was not really attractive and it was obstrusing. Furthermore, it was not Open Source, 
so for curious like me, I could not see how was made his extension (I mean I easily could access it by searching 
the folder associated to the extension ID, but nah).
