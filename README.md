# Auto LinkedIn
This Chrome extension allows you to automatically add contacts in LinkedIn. 
I had this idea when I saw someone's post on my LinkedIn feed. He made a similar thing, 
but I found that the design was not really attractive and it was obstrusing. Furthermore, it was not Open Source, 
so for curious like me, I could not see how was made his extension (I mean I easily could access it by searching 
the folder associated to the extension ID, but nah).

## Secret code
If you are a bit curious and tend to like exploration, you may have noticed that if you say "Non" 
when asked you if you want to add people, the plugin disable itself while you don't provide the secret
code. If you are here, I have no doubt that you'll easilfy find this code !
